# WCR Charity policy
The Weir Common Room Constitution states that the WCR may dedicate in its budget up to £500 per academic year for charitable donations. In making use of these funds, the WCR shall refer to the following guidelines:

1.  The WCR may consider making a donation to any charity in which one or more WCR members is/are directly involved. This includes sponsoring WCR members for their direct participation in fundraising events for charity (i.e. Races, cycling events, etc.).

1.  The WCR committee shall proceed through a call for applications at any time during Hillary term each year.

1.  The WCR committe (preferably through its Treasurer or Diversity, Equality, and Welfare Officers) shall advertise the call for applications, requirements and deadline to all WCR members.

1.  Applications should be submitted via email or pidged to the Treasurer or Diversity, Equality, and Welfare Officers before the advertised deadline.

1.  Applications shall be no more than one page long and minimally include the following:
    1.  The name of the (lead) WCR member;
    1.  The name of the charity, including full contact details and website (if available);
    1.  A short description of the charity’s objectives and activities;
    1.  A short description of the WCR member’s involvement with the organization;
    1.  A short description of the projected use of the WCR’s financial contribution.

1.  The WCR committee shall evaluate applications and make decisions within 2 weeks of the deadline. It shall inform the successful applicants by email and advertise the outcome to all WCR members.

1.  Each member of the WCR may submit only one application (for one charity), individually or as part of a group, per academic year. A maximum donation from the WCR is set at £50 per WCR member, or £100 per project or charity (in case of group applications).

1.  Budgeted funds do not have to be entirely allocated each year. In the absence of suitable applications, the WCR committee can decide not to make any donation and make these sums available for other similar purposes, make a new call for applications in Trinity term or decide upon another appropriate use of this portfolio.

1. The WCR committee may exceptionally consider unsolicited applications at other moments in the academic year (e.g. for fundraising events happening in MT or TT). Such applications shall follow the guidelines above. The committee may decide favourably even if the budgeted sums have already been allocated, as long as the total WCR contributions for the academic year have not reached a maximum of £500.
